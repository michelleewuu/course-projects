# Tests adding two nodes, one self-pointing edge 
# and one edge between two nodes to graph.

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_two_edges_graph2

# Add two nodes
added node a to two_nodes_two_edges_graph2
added node b to two_nodes_two_edges_graph2

# Add two edges (including one self-pointing edge)
added edge AA from a to a in two_nodes_two_edges_graph2
added edge AB from a to b in two_nodes_two_edges_graph2

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_two_edges_graph2 contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_two_edges_graph2 are: a(AA) b(AB)
the children of b in two_nodes_two_edges_graph2 are:
