# Same as TwoNodeNoEdge.test, but reverse the 
# order of node adding to test if it prints 
# out in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_graph_reverse

# Add two nodes in reverse alphabetical order
added node b to two_nodes_graph_reverse
added node a to two_nodes_graph_reverse

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
