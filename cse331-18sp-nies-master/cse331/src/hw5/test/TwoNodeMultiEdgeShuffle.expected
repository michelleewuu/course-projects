# Same as TwoNodeMultiEdge.test but shuffles the order 
# of adding edges

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph
added node b to two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph

# Add five edges
added edge AB1 from a to b in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph
added edge AA from a to a in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph
added edge AB2 from a to b in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph
added edge BB from b to b in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph
added edge BA from b to a in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph are: a(AA) b(AB1) b(AB2)
the children of b in two_nodes_multi_edges_shuffle_graph are: a(BA) b(BB)
