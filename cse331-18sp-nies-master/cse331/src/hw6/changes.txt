Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

1. I changed how a Node is connected to Edges starting from it,
   I used a field in class Node to store all Edges starting from it before
   But this is hard to access and make changes because the field storing
   Edges is private in class Node. In my new LabeledMultiGraph, I use a Map
   to store Nodes in the graph and their corresponding Edges with each Node 
   as key of accessing Edges starting from it. Also, I delete the field storing
   Edges in Node and all methods related to it in class Node.

2. I changed the data structure of storing Edges related to a certain Node from
   ArrayList to HashSet. Because HashSet is of O(1) when checking whether contains
   a certain Edge or not, while ArrayList is of O(n), which is much slower. And 
   checking whether an Edge is already in the graph happens a lot when building 
   marvelGraph in class MarvelPath, so changing this data structure makes code run
   much faster.
